# PyGit

Even though I have been using Git for a while, I don't think I fully understand how it works
under the hood. After reading [Julia Evans' blog](https://jvns.ca/)(great blogs!!!), I decide to re-implement tools that I have been using. For `PyGit`, it's a implementation of `Git` based on the spec from [Mary Rose Cook's essay](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out).
